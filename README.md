- **HTTP responses standarization** - Using `axum_responses` crate
- **Dependency Injection** - Built-in DI support
- **Asynchronous by default** - Built on top of `axum` and `tokio`
- **Interactive CLI** - Built to improve the developer experience

sword = "0.2.0"
```

### Basic web server

```rust
use sword::prelude::*;
use serde_json::Value;

#[controller("/")]
struct AppController;

#[routes]
impl AppController {
    #[get("/hello")]
    async fn hello(&self) -> HttpResponse {
        HttpResponse::Ok().message("Hello, World!")
    }

    #[post("/submit")]
    async fn submit_data(&self, req: Request) -> HttpResult {
        let body = req.body::<Value>()?;

        Ok(HttpResponse::Ok()
            .data(body)
            .message("Data submitted successfully"))
    }
}

#[sword::main]
async fn main() {
    let app = Application::builder()
        .with_controller::<AppController>()
        .build();

    app.run().await;
}
```
